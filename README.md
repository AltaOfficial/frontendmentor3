### Built with

### What I learned

I learned doing this project that transitions don't work with gradients in CSS, there are most likely workarounds but I'm sad it's not built in ðŸ˜•, I also learned that using textContent over innerText or inner HTML can prevent XSS attacks and that the attribute bracket in CSS applies for more than just selecting elements by type.

### Continued development

I really like the result of this project but when it came to aligning and position the elements it took longer than id like it to, so in the future id like to work on more projects that challenge me in that way.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid_item.asp) - This helped me figure out how to move the image container to the other side in desktop mode.
- [Resource 2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-position-a-div-at-the-bottom-of-its-container-using-css) - Helped me figure out how to position the dismiss button at the bottom.
- [Resource 3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp) - Needed help centering the dismiss button on the success page.
